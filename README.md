# consortium-network

default env paths before running docker compose up or using the /network/*.sh scripts:
* $QUORUM_VERSION: Defaults to -2.7.0
* ${QUORUM_CONSENSUS: Default to IBFT -istanbul which means consortium members dont have to trust each other as long as the majority of validators are trustable
